It can be an outer layer when the weather is just starting to get crisp (or when you just want an extra dose of cozy when you're lounging inside). It can be a middle layer when you need to add a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>winter coat</a> on top. And it can be a base layer in more extreme weather with a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>puffer coat</a>. But which one do you choose?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“A worthy fleece jacket is warm enough to serve as an outer layer, can accommodate layers underneath, and has practical design elements like zippered pockets,” says Stitch Fix stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Jessica Sockel</a>. She also notes that the fleece has become <strong>a fashion item, not just a functional piece</strong>. “Fleece jackets are a practical staple for honing the ‘gorpcore’ trend, an outdoorsy aesthetic that draws inspiration from outdoor and recreational activities like camping and hiking, but can be incorporated into your everyday rotation.” Fleeces are also great for texture: “Wearing fabrics like leather or faux leather with a fleece jacket creates a nice contrast of soft and edgy.” So if you pick the right one, it can be much more versatile than you expect.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To find the very best available, we spoke with Sockel, designer and sewist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Aaronica B.

We wore it to run errands, go for walks, as a layering piece for date night, and everywhere in between. It was <strong>perfect for 60 degrees and cooler</strong>, meaning it was great for transitional weather. We didn't test it in rain, but it worked well in fog without getting moist like other fleeces, and we could wear it alone without an outer layer in cooler temperatures.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When we sized up, we could layer the jacket under a heavier coat or over a sweater. The lack of bulk meant we received the benefits of a warm layer without feeling the accompanying heaviness, and the stretch meant there was <strong>no stiffness </strong>or limited range of motion. This doesn’t feel as soft as traditional fleece, but it was just as effective. Cole notes that it would be <strong>good for a workout </strong>(but notes that it’s not as size-inclusive as other options on this list). And as Singla points out, “It features an <strong>under-the-helmet hood </strong>so it’s perfect for biking as well.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Other pros include the <strong>zippered pockets </strong>(great for when we weren’t carrying a purse). It’s also <strong>machine-washable</strong> — and still <strong>looked as good as new after a wash</strong>, which was especially impressive. It can be a bit more of an investment than other fleeces on this list, but the fact that it does so much and remains light and thin means that it’s a fleece we’re turning to again and again.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Polyester (some recycled), spandex breathable stretch double weave with a DWR (durable water repellent) finish | <strong>Colors:</strong> 2 | <strong>Size:</strong> XXS–XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-warm-athleta-tugga-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Most Warm</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Athleta Tugga Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Athleta Tugga Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/uHij0RoVcYpGbgHc65mIwQFzsOo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Athleta-Tugga-Jacket-2dab199b339f4ce0badaf333fca01893.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Athleta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> This is warm and fluffy, but not too bulky.

After machine washing the jacket, the dense fabric somehow became more fluffy, which is an incredible feature.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You may want to <strong>size down if you’re between sizes;</strong> ours was a little big, but the smaller size would have been too tight. The material is <strong>soft and stretchy</strong> and designed to be layered — we can get a bulky sweater under there with no issues, which is often key to transitional weather dressing. But it’s also worth noting that the jacket is on the longer side and may hit low at your waist (even with the petite sizing).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This wouldn't be a fleece for working out, as it’s easy to overheat when sweating. But it would be a fabulous pick<strong> for a long, slow hike or a day outside</strong> — it’s a nice-looking jacket, so it works great for the fashion-forward. It's also optimal for people who get cold easily and want to throw on one jacket and leave the house. Cole loves its size-inclusivity and adds, “It’s cute enough to be worn off the trails and functional enough to be worn on them.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Polyester/recycled polyester | <strong>Colors:</strong> 3 | <strong>Size:</strong> XXS–3X</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-heavyweight-alo-yoga-foxy-sherpa-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Heavyweight</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Alo Yoga Foxy Sherpa Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Alo Yoga Foxy Sherpa Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/W_UbrvBez-8Kr_-1iWoemSitxGg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Alo-Yoga-Foxy-Sherpa-Jacket-ba4bf103102b4478a3aeec6d17dd191e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Alo Yoga</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> Nice weight, nice look, and a really warm experience.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s bulky, so it’s not as layerable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We wore this at home and to run errands in 40- to 50-degree weather (when it was cold in our apartment and we needed an extra layer). It’s <strong>true to size</strong>, without any tightness or bagginess, and very cozy — perfect for working from home. The fleece is a medium-pile (plush but not too shaggy) and <strong>has a fabric lining for warmth and wind protection</strong>. It does run a bit bulky, which makes sense given that it’s heavy, but you’ll want to wear it as an outer layer instead of under another jacket.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The <strong>removable hood</strong> is such a nice feature, and the <strong>collar is tall,</strong> which means when you pop it up it’ll <strong>cover your neck nicely</strong>. The pockets are roomy enough to fit a phone and have zippers to keep items like your wallet secure. We felt like we could move freely, even though the jacket is thick, warm, and windproof. <strong>The insulation is fabulous</strong>, and (even though we wouldn’t wear this to work out), it’s perfect for walking around a city or even heading to the gym. <strong>After a wash cycle, the jacket held up well </strong>(no shrinking or pilling), and there was no wear and tear. Even though we have other fleeces, this one makes it to the top of the list because it’s worth the value for money.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Polyester | <strong>Colors:</strong> 4 | <strong>Size:</strong> XS–L</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-lightweight-outdoor-voices-recfleece-snap-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Lightweight</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Outdoor Voices RecFleece Snap Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="REI Outdoor Voices RecFleece Snap Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/rIi0YKKEGO1HnvNYZcCU_Y8GOZo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Outdoor-Voices-RecFleece-Snap-Jacket-0e2d9cf7055f4d2dab236821adfd0b7c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>REI</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> Even though it’s light, it’s still relatively protective against the elements.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Because it’s lightweight, you're not choosing this as your cold-weather coat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This is a perfect fleece to throw on over a t-shirt for casual trips in the neighborhood or to the store (although we’ve also worn it on longer trips, including for our commute). We<strong> sized up for layering purposes</strong>, and we actually love the oversized look because the fleece isn’t bulky or boxy. It’s <strong>low pile</strong> (dense and short) and the design is pretty simple and nondescript, but it still works with a bunch of casual outfits. It was <strong>breathable but still protective from the elements</strong> on windy and cold days, so we never felt like we were about to overheat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The jacket’s <strong>incredibly soft to the touch</strong> and, thus, also very cozy. It would not be warm enough for winter (it’s best for transitional weather on its own) but because it’s layerable, it would be great with a puffer or pea coat. The <strong>front pockets are pleasantly deep </strong>and work either for a phone, a wallet, and keys or for a place to put your hands when they're cold. The <strong>fleece has buttons instead of zippers</strong>, but they stay closed securely. We don’t know that we’d recommend this for running since the construction felt better for recreation, but it would work for a walk. It was easy to wash out stains and felt a bit stiff after we washed it, but after a wear or two, it was back to its original coziness.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Recycled polyester | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Size:</strong> XXS–XXXL</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-12 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2655 data-sizes=750px alt="Person wearing a buttoned Outdoor Voices RecFleece Snap Jacket" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/4xcbIPjH7FSQQk2lxNssjFvdfeo=/fit-in/1500x2655/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-womens-fleece-jackets-test-outdoor-voices-recsnap-button-abby-moore-12-a62832eaa88c40abb7ef09a68be9da91.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Abby Moore</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2607 data-sizes=750px alt="Person wearing an Outdoor Voices RecFleece Snap Jacket" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/RB200jqjJJ0QuW53gqeLkjtycPs=/fit-in/1500x2607/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/shp-womens-fleece-jackets-test-outdoor-voices-recsnap-button-abby-moore-13-da823890c9ca49f983c2bb9e0ba81424.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Shape / Abby Moore</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-quarter-zip-patagonia-womens-lightweight-synchilla-snap-t-fleece-pullover></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Quarter Zip</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Patagonia Women's Lightweight Fleece Pullover</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="REI Patagonia Women's Lightweight Synchilla Snap-T Fleece Pullover" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/sq_4vdvHSgMsfjtmIiRJAY9W_Oo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Patagonia-Womens-Lightweight-Synchilla-Snap-T-Fleece-Pullover-a25913d7bbeb4b4e8325fcff4690470d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>REI</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> This is durable and wearable in a variety of transitional weather conditions.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>We wish there was more than a single chest pocket.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We wore this fleece all day long, from lounging at home to walking the dog to running errands. It worked just as well in 50-degree weather as it did in 20-degree weather (if anything, it was a little warm in the higher temps). Even on our bare skin, the <strong>low-pile</strong> material felt luscious. It’s true to size, but if you'd like to layer shirts underneath, you may want to size up. We’d recommend this as a fashion fleece, not an athletic one.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The trim at the cuffs and hem (which is made of spandex) seal the jacket, keeping out the cold air and helping you retain your body heat. The<strong> stand-up collar </strong>is also a nice addition to keep your neck warm. We washed it on a normal cycle and there were no signs of wear and tear or any degradation to the material. Patagonia’s more expensive than other fleeces, but the quality (and ethical, sustainable construction) speaks for itself — as well as the fact that it will take the jacket back when it’s worn and give you credit for a new product.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material</strong>: Recycled polyester | <strong>Colors:</strong> 8 | <strong>Size:</strong> XXS–XXL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-high-pile-vuori-womens-cozy-sherpa-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best High-Pile</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Vuori Cozy Sherpa Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Vuori Cozy Sherpa Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/azGxejCaC5zHN4vhSIO-MHBgu6o=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Vuori-Cozy-Sherpa-Jacket-d3f3b907186341ce97a628ef4d72c57e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Vuori</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s so cute that we get compliments from passers-by and friends.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s not lined, so it’s not warm.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’ve been wearing this jacket almost daily and in a variety of everyday settings. It’s structured as an <strong>oversized bomber</strong>, so for a roomy fit, go true to size, and for a tighter fit, size down. The fabric feels like shearling, even though it’s polyester, and <strong>there’s no lining</strong> — so it’s not for super-cold, windy weather. Yet! It’s still cozy around the house and in warmer transitional temps.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The zipper front with extra button flaps means that it closes tightly against the elements, and the <strong>zippered pockets are nice for a phone and keys</strong> — though not, perhaps, for a ton of stuff. We received compliments while running errands and dog-walking, and Singla notes this would be “perfect for a cool morning hike.” It also washed well (and didn’t lose its texture like other shearling-like coats we own), and our impression is that it’ll remain durable, even though the material is on the thinner side. The cost is higher, to no surprise, but feeling like you’re wearing a cute and stylish blanket that strangers stop to admire feels worth it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Recycled polyester, polyester, polyamide | <strong>Colors:</strong> 5 | <strong>Size:</strong> XXS–XXL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cropped-the-north-face-womens-cragmont-fleece-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cropped</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>The North Face Cragmont Fleece Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon The North Face Women's Cragmont Fleece Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ib4EHg1APHTFL0Mpsta-uGQ4IRQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/The-North-Face-Womens-Cragmont-Fleece-Jacket-704a45c16ded40b6861f681f59e532de.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> It’s very fashionable, and the contrasting colors are super-chic.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>You’re paying more for the name brand.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When the weather dipped below 60 degrees, this was our jacket — <strong>lightweight, but still incredibly warm.</strong> It feels like<strong> a cross between a blanket and a cloud</strong> and runs true to size for exceptional sizing (with a boxy, breathable fit). It’s worth it to note, though, that even though it shows longer on the model, <strong>on us it felt quite cropped</strong> (a little below our waists). If you’re looking for longer, in other words, this isn’t it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The fleece is <strong>low-pile and thin</strong>, but in windy weather, there wasn’t a ton of cold air that seeped in. (It’s high performance for something so thin, in other words — pretty comparable to other North Face fleeces we’ve owned.) The contrasting color in the zipper, pocket linings, and buttons was such a cool look that you don’t see in every fleece jacket. The<strong> front pockets are tall </strong>and can hold things such as hand sanitizer and earbuds alongside our wallet, keys, and phone. It’s good for layering, which is a plus. And after a wash in cold water, the fleece looked and felt the same. A flaw is that there were some loose threads along the stitching of the jacket; however, it didn’t affect the overall quality of the jacket. “It’s giving the people what we want — cute while being very functional. And it’s size inclusive!” Cole adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Recycled polyester | <strong>Colors:</strong> 4 | <strong>Size:</strong> XS–XXL; 1X–3X<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-long-helly-hansen-womens-maud-pile-fleece-jacket-zip-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Long</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Helly Hansen Maud Pile Fleece Jacket Zip Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Helly Hansen Women&amp;acirc;s Maud Pile Fleece Jacket Zip Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/NwMmmpND2qt0yNbzmK9_qFeuF9Q=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Helly-Hansen-Womens-Maud-Pile-Fleece-Jacket-Zip-Jacket-1be96f60fa154a8bbbde674666441190.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The longer length makes this such a great piece of outerwear.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s not best for keeping out wind and moisture.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether it was to and from dance class, to and from work, or to and from errands and brunch, this was a great fleece to use. The size finder was spot on and gave us insight into which option would fit us perfectly. There’s <strong>enough room to wear sweaters and hoodies underneath</strong>, and the longer length (that covers the hips and has a cool curved hem) is a nice unique feature that you don’t see in a lot of fleeces.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The fleece felt synthetic to us but still soft and cozy. It’s low-pile but still has a nice weight and “hang” to it. The sleeves hit us perfectly, and <strong>the two pockets were deep and well-placed for our hands </strong>or our essentials. The hood was generous instead of too tight (meaning we could still pull it over our heads when our hair was in a bun), which meant that there was a little airflow up top — but it wasn’t excessive. When it was windy, we felt it through the jacket, but it was warm enough for mid-fall temps; we also occasionally felt a little condensation, but not in every context. A casual stroll, city walking, or even apple-picking would be perfect events for this.<strong> This is machine-washable and even felt a tiny bit softer afterward.</strong> It’s stylish, which for us means it’s more versatile than sportier fleeces.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Polyester (recycled) | <strong>Colors:</strong> 3 | <strong>Size:</strong> XS–XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-fitted-patagonia-womens-r1-air-full-zip-hoody></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Fitted</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Patagonia Women's Full-zip Hoody</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Patagonia Women's R1 Air Full-zip Hoody" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/p3U0SuEaXqZMwKSgC6A6KHu3H1s=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Patagonia-Womens-R1-Air-Full-zip-Hoody-24e46ff541ce435bb4b6eedd5a126094.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Patagonia</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> This is a great fleece for running (or other activities).</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s not size-inclusive.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Anytime we needed an extra layer, we threw on this fleece, sometimes for hours at a time. It's true to size if you like a fitted jacket, although size up if you like an oversized feel. It's soft, even though it’s not the typical “plush” fleece. The extra weaving on the jacket means <strong>it's extremely wind-resistant</strong>, and there’s no airflow — but it’s still breathable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In general, we felt well-insulated when this fleece was on (but not so much that we were a sweaty mess). The small breast pocket only fits keys or a credit card, but the bottom external pockets are much bigger. This <strong>could work for more intense activities like hiking or running</strong>, and we had a full range of movement. The hood is a nice feature here since it obscured some of our face and made a tight seal from the wind. But like many of the options on this list, the fact that this doesn’t come in extended sizing is a con (which is a problem across Patagonia products). With more sizing, this would be a failsafe pick for all.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Recycled polyester | <strong>Colors:</strong> 6 | <strong>Size:</strong> XXS–XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-hooded-rei-co-op-womens-hyperaxis-fleece-jacket-20></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Hooded</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>REI Co-op Hyperaxis Fleece Jacket 2.0</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="REI Co-op Women's Hyperaxis Fleece Jacket 2.0" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/3S6EtYI2dzQnaQde5PtvQtI6Xb8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/REI-Co-op-Womens-Hyperaxis-Fleece-Jacket-2.0-bc415efb440d4131a2eb96254d738084.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>REI</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This is Patagonia-level quality with some added benefits.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s better for the colder weather.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This medium-weight fleece worked from short walks to 8-hour workdays as a transitional layer to keep us warm (and when we didn’t want to wear a heavier coat). <strong>We sized up and it fit perfectly</strong>, with the capability for layering over a tee and sweater or under something heavier. It has a great feel — smooth and almost spongey on the outside, then cozy low-pile fleece on the outside. <strong>Added stretch meant we had a full range of motion </strong>but there wasn’t any bagginess after multiple wears. It’s not windproof, but it is wind-resistant. And as a bonus, we never felt frumpy wearing it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The outer pockets are great — but they’re not fleece, so we wish they were warmer. There’s also <strong>a chest pocket, which is big enough to hold a phone.</strong> There's a <strong>hood lined with fleece, </strong>and it's super-effective at protecting our ears and mouth. The thumb cutouts at the sleeve are also a nice, unique feature for keeping the sleeves in place. It might not be a running fleece in the warmer weather, but it could work for when it’s colder (and could be a nice hiking layer, too). Compared to Patagonia fleeces we’ve had in the past, this compares well — the pocket placements are better, the hood is awesome, and the material is stretchier. This felt like quality fabric even after washing and was quick-drying to boot.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Polyester, nylon, Lycra spandex | <strong>Colors:</strong> 3 | <strong>Size:</strong> XS–XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-lounging-wild-rye-danner-high-pile-fleece-pullover></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Lounging</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Wild Rye Danner High-pile Fleece Pullover</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Wild Rye Danner High-Pile Fleece Pullover" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/N-G28DBMClmnV3w7ofE2PZ_of7Y=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Wild-Rye-Danner-High-Pile-Fleece-Pullover-9c82c995c69549e5a8907333dd356a94.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Wild Rye</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> It’s so cozy that it should practically come with a book and some tea.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It didn’t hold up well to washing, and it's best for inside.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We wore this while out and about, headed to workouts, and going to and from events with friends. We also wore this to the airport and on a plane (and it worked great for the seven-hour flight!) It’s <strong>true to size and cut for a fitted look.</strong> This, combined with the high-pile fleece, makes for little to no airflow. We found it <strong>best for lounging and cozying up at home or running a quick errand </strong>— perfect for days when you want to be snug without a ton of bulk.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It's not completely fleece-lined (the pockets aren’t), but it’s soft on the inside as well as the outside. The pockets are huge and zippered, and there’s a <strong>cord at the bottom of the jacket for a more fitted look.</strong> Air can sometimes flow through the arm holes, but it’s not excessive. The fleece held up well to washing but felt a little flatter afterward. In general, this is <strong>a no-frills option,</strong> but it still kept us warm without making us feel like a marshmallow, so it’s still a win.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Recycled polyester, polyester | <strong>Colors:</strong> 2 | <strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-colorful-cotopaxi-womens-teca-fleece-full-zip-jacket-zip-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Colorful</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cotopaxi Teca Fleece Full-zip Jacket Zip Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Cotopaxi Women's Teca Fleece Full-Zip Jacket Zip Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/s85R79AXcI__sIOdiKrLUmnaA-k=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Cotopaxi-Womens-Teca-Fleece-Full-Zip-Jacket-Zip-Jacket-53d343bf9163445ca27a2e0450da3a82.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Cotopaxi</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The colors are gorgeous, and there are a ton of options available.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It makes our torso look a little lumpy and bumpy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For long walks and running errands in a glorious colorful fleece, this is the pick. The pretty colorways with stripes on the front are an absolute standout compared to most monochrome fleeces. It looks a little retro, which we loved when we had it on. It runs true to size (if a bit long in the sleeves), and is soft to the touch. It’s <strong>low-pile,</strong> but still soft even though it’s compact.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The zipper can push up against our neck when zipped up all the way, which is a little annoying. But<strong> there are several pockets, including two on the interior,</strong> and they’re easily accessible. There’s a little airflow, but we only experienced it once in less than 50-degree weather. It insulates well but is still breathable, and was almost too warm when we wore it in the car. It’s a great fall layer, and we found ourselves grabbing it more than other jackets we had because of the ease — just zip up and go! With that said, it’s not the most flattering jacket, but it still threads the needle between activewear and fashion wear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Recycled polyester | <strong>Colors:</strong> 10 | <strong>Size:</strong> XXS–4X</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-38 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2660 data-sizes=750px alt="Woman wearing a Cotopaxi Women's Teca Fleece Full-Zip Jacket Zip Jacket outside" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/bgatewemF93dvtTSo_n8Qo8cHrw=/fit-in/1500x2660/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/byr-womens-fleece-jackets-test-cotopaxi-teca-full-zip-zip-kimberly-souza-16-309b61b2105a4134b35e26b3de3ddef9.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Byrdie / Kimberly Souza</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2663 data-sizes=750px alt="Person with their hand in the pocket of a Cotopaxi Women's Teca Fleece Full-Zip Jacket Zip Jacket" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Tc47k5P-GVuGfnnF6pfCNZczAhM=/fit-in/1500x2663/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-womens-fleece-jackets-test-cotopaxi-teca-full-zip-zip-kimberly-souza-9-046e245f3f9d40fe8046ad13d3c5632b.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Kimberly Souza</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Warmth and Pile<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While you’re shopping for fleece, you’ll probably note that some are high-pile and some are low-pile. Generally,<strong> the higher the pile, the more tall and loose the fibers are</strong> (and thus the softer the fabric will be, as well as heavier and denser),<strong> whereas lower pile fleece will have shorter and tighter fibers — less fluff,</strong> oftentimes less weight, and not as cozy. But there are uses for both: a low-pile fleece might be <strong>nice for a lightweight hiking jacket </strong>that works as an extra layer instead of a heavyweight jacket.<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Construction and Fit<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to thinking through the specs you prefer (Do you want pockets? A hood? Thumb straps? Drawstring hems?), consider a tight vs. loose fit: “If you intend to wear it underneath your outermost layer, opt for a snug fit so you don’t feel too bulky. If you’re planning to wear the fleece as your primary coat, I suggest going with a slightly roomier style that will allow room for chunky sweaters underneath without feeling restrictive,” Sockel says.</p><p>Cole likes a boxier fit — the better to layer underneath. She also adds that <strong>“the tighter the knit, the better it’ll retain heat.”</strong> Singla notes that the construction of the top of the fleece matters, whether full zip, quarter zip, half zip, or pullover — which comes down to personal preference. Make sure it's breathable, too, because “you don’t want to turn into a sweaty mess,” says Cole, and prioritize fleeces that are <strong>water-resistant.</strong></p><p>“We also recommend looking for <strong>anti-static or treated fabrics </strong>as some fleece materials can generate static electricity, leading to discomfort and attracting lint,” Sockel says. And, as Singla reminds us, always check to make sure the zipper is durable and easy to pull up and down.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Length and Layering<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The fleeces on this list range from cropped to the waist to long and mid-thigh. Whichever you choose depends on your preference, but for a heavyweight fleece that's acting as a fall and winter jacket, it helps to have it longer.</p><p>“When styling our clients who live in cold climates, we like to suggest trying Stitch Fix’s ‘<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">three-layer rule</a>.’ This styling method incorporates three distinct layers (a base, a middle layer, and an outer layer) that can be taken on and off throughout the day to account for shifts in the temperature or weather," says Sockel.

That’s not to say other brands don’t have great options, but if you're pressed for time and just want to pick one you know will work, stick to a classic fleece brand.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Which is the warmest fleece?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s an easy way to determine how warm your fleece is: the grams per square meter. “We’re looking at 200–300 grams per square meter” for the warmest options, says Cole. Singla adds that anything less than 100 grams per square meter is a micro-fleece (and thus very light) and 300 is the heaviest out there. “Heavy fleece weights of 300 grams per square meter are warm and can insulate, but they can be bulky and not as ideal for mobility, breathability, and layering,” she adds, so just bear that in mind.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Singla also notes that you want to pay attention to which of the three types of fleece you’re buying. “Polar fleece is a double-sided fabric that is cozy and warm. You don’t get windproofing or water resistance, but it’s still a really good option for fleece, and it’s affordable. Knit fleece features a heathered knit face fabric, and they are typically warm and cozy and a good alternative to wool cardigans or jackets. They are usually thick and bulky. Sherpa fleece is a lofty, high-pile fleece. It’s bulky, casual, and cozy.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Is expensive fleece worth it?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You might be paying more for a more durable, all-weather, workout-appropriate fleece. Notes Singla, “A casual fleece is cozy and good for everyday wear, especially to layer when it's cold. Performance fleece is usually more fitted and stretchy and has high-tech fabrics like Polartech.” A high-quality fleece will be heavy but soft, with a dense knit for better insulation, she adds. There should also be a treatment on the fleece to prevent it from pilling, says Cole. “And choosing higher quality fleece will help to reduce pilling, making the garment last longer,” she adds.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Katherine J.
